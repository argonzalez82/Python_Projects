# Find the biggest value in a given list.
# Try it by using only a temporary variable, a for loop, and an if to
# compare the values. I prefilled the list in the answer box, but in
# case you need it again, here it is:

the_list = [1, 2, 40, 5, 10]

# Code Algorithm based on constraints listed above.
# I need a for loop with a temp. variable that iterates throught the_list
for i in the_list:
    if i == max(the_list):  # If-esle statement that will compare each
        print(i)            # item in the_list and print out the largest.

# Python program to find largest
# number in a list

# list of numbers
list1 = [10, 20, 4, 45, 99]

# printing the maximum element
print("Largest element is:", max(list1))
print(50)
