??????????   HOW TO ABSORB A TEXT BOOK LIKE A SPONGE ????????????????

1. Flip thru each page - go thru each page without reading just look. 
   this just helps familar your self with the text a bit and builds suspicion.
   
2. Go to the end & take the Quiz,
    This creates a map of whats important.

3. Go thru the chapter & Read the bold print
    Just the bold print like titles and chapter headers and explanations. 

4. 1st & last sentence of each paragraph - just that 1st and last

5. Now Read the Chapter and enjoy..
