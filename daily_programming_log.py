The purpose of this log is to write ideas and leave a daily 
log of where I am at with my Programming Studies. 

# I choose to save the log as .py file just incase I decide to write 
# code in the log I can refer to the python syntax in sublime text. 
# Plus the colors look awesome when I use a python keyword :P


Daily Log : 


December 22, 2020

I have decided to unenroll myself from the data science specialization in "R"
it was a fun journey but after much reflection and examing the advice of both 
Kendy and Bro. Carr I decided it would have more value to focus on Python and 
C++ and start building projects. I hope to pick up "R" agin in future projects. 
Yet right now I am not satisfied with the progress I made in the last 6 months 
with the JHU Data specialization in "R" I feel another 6 months will not be a 
good use of my time with my current workload with the kids being home online 
learning and my recovery. 

So the Areas I will focus moving forward, for the next 6 months will be: 

#One big caveat, Im going to stop spending money on Books for my studies in 
#at least for the next 6 months and focus reading the books I have 
#and the free online resources, if I sign up for anyting it will like 
#be something interactive like DataQuest IO and not lecture and assignments 
#for the time being.


Main Focus will be to Python Job ready by June, When the kids are home for 
the Summer to start a PT/FT remote job coding. 

30 Day Focus / Game Plan 

Python Beginning knowledge, 
1. Continue with HackerRank Challenges.
2. ReRead/ Skim through the  "The Self Thought Programmer Book." 
3. "Kaggel" Python Mini Course  
4. ReRead "Introductory to Python" 
   (Maybe Order the Second Edition - 
   	if you trade some of the other books you are not going to use??)

5. Hobbie Studies at night when you are next to a computer, 
	C++ and Linux to stay fresh on those topics. 

	But the main focus for the next 30 days will be Python and to build 
	Several projects using Python and associated libraries. 



6 month Game Plan.  ---   Job Ready by June 2021....
"This year I will be able to say I am a Pythonista - Developer/ Enginneer \
and Maybe Data Scientist"
